## Set model options ##
# factors: number of factors. By default, the model does not automatically learn the number of factors. If you want the model to do this (based on a minimum variance explained criteria), set `TrainOptions$dropFactorThreshold` to a non-zero value.
# likelihoods: list with the likelihood for each view. Usually we recommend: 
#	- gaussian for continuous data
# 	- bernoulli for binary data
#  	- poisson for count data
# learnIntercept: boolean indicating whether to learn an intercept term to capture the feature means. 
# 	If you are using gaussian likelihoods, we recommend centering the data (specified in data_options) and setting learnIntercept to False. 
# 	However, if you have non-gaussian likelihoods, learning an intercept factor is important
# sparsity: boolean indicating whether to use sparsity. 
# 	This is always recommended, as it will make the loadings more interpretable.
ep.set_model_options(factors=25, likelihoods=["gaussian","bernoulli","poisson"], learnIntercept=True, sparsity=True)

## Set data options ##

# view_names: list with view names
# center_features: boolean indicating whether to center the features to zero mean. 
# 	This only works for gaussian data. Default is TRUE.
# scale_views: boolean indicating whether to scale views to have the same unit variance. 
# 	As long as the scale differences between the data sets is not too high, this is not required. Default is False.
# removeIncompleteSamples: boolean indicating whether to remove samples that are not profiled in all omics. 
# 	We recommend this only for testing, as the model can cope with samples having missing assays. Default is False.
ep.set_data_options(center_features=True, scale_views=False, removeIncompleteSamples=False)

# Parse the data (optionally center or scale, do some QC, etc.)
ep.parse_data()

# Define training options
# iter: numeric value indicating the maximum number of iterations. 
# 	Default is 1000, but we recommend using the 'tolerance' as convergence criteria.
# tolerance: numeric value indicating the convergence threshold based on the change in Evidence Lower Bound (deltaELBO). 
# 	For quick exploration we recommend this to be around 1.0, and for a thorough training we recommend a value of 0.01. Default is 0.1
# dropR2: numeric hyperparamter to automatically learn the number of factors. 
# 	It indicates the threshold on fraction of variance explained to consider a factor inactive and automatically drop it from the model during training. 
# 	For example, a value of 0.01 implies that factors explaining less than 1% of variance (in each view) will be dropped. 
# 	Default is 0, which implies that only factors that explain no variance at all will be removed
# elbofreq: frequency of computation of the ELBO.
# 	It is useful for convergence, but it slows down the model
# verbose: boolean indicating whether to generate a verbose output.
# seed: random seed
# 	By default it is sampled randomly
ep.set_train_options(iter=1000, tolerance=0.01, dropR2=0.00, elbofreq=1, verbose=False, seed=2018)

# Define prior distributions
ep.define_priors()

# Define initialisations of variational distributions

# Parse intercept factor

# Train the model

# Save the model

# This is the end of the python pipeline.
# Now you are ready to switch to the R framework for downstream analysis.
